                    <h2>Subjects of study</h2><br>

                    <p>
                        At the Awesome Science Faculty, we have a pretty open-minded<br>
                        research facility — as long as the subjects fall somewhere<br>
                        in the realm of science and technology. You seem like an intelligent,<br> 
                        dedicated researcher, and just the kind of person we'd like to have<br>
                        on our team. Saying that, of the ideas you submitted we were most<br>
                        intrigued by are as follows, in order of priority:<br>
                    </p>

                    <ol>
                        <li>Turning H2O into wine, and the health benefits of Resveratrol (C<sub>14</sub>H<sub>12</sub>O<sub>3</sub>.)</li>
                        <li>
                            Measuring the effect on performance of funk <br>
                        bassplayers at temperatures exceeding 30<sup>°</sup>C (86<sup>°</sup>F), <br>
                        when the audience size exponentially increases <br>
                        (effect of 3 × 10<sup>3</sup> &gt; to 3 × 10<sup>4</sup>.)<br>
                        </li>
                        <li><abbr title="HyperText Markup Language">HTML</abbr> and <abbr title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</abbr> constructs for representing musical scores.</li>
                    </ol>

                    <p>
                        So please can you provide more information on each <br>
                        of these subjects, including how long you'd expect <br> 
                        the research to take, required staff and other resources,<br>
                        and anything else you think we'd need to know? Thanks.<br>
                    </p>

                    <h2>Exotic dance moves</h2>

                    <p>
                        Yes, you are right! As part of my post-doctorate work, <br>
                        I did study exotic tribal dances. To answer your <br>
                        question, my favourite dances are as follows, with definitions: <br>
                    </p>
                    <dl>
                        <dt>Polynesian chicken dance</dt>
                        <dd>
                            A little known but very influential dance <br> 
                            dating back as far as 300<abbr title="Before Common Era">BC</abbr>, a whole village <br> 
                            would dance around in a circle like chickens, <br> 
                            to encourage their livestock to be "fruitful".
                        </dd>
                        <dt>Icelandic brownian shuffle</dt>
                        <dd>
                            Before the Icelanders developed fire as a means <br> 
                            of getting warm, they used to practice this dance, <br> 
                            which involved huddling close together in a circle <br> 
                            on the floor, and shuffling their bodies around in <br> 
                            imperceptibly tiny, very rapid movements. One of my <br> 
                            fellow students used to say that he thought this dance <br> 
                            inspired modern styles such as Twerking.
                        </dd>
                        <dt>Arctic robot dance</dt>
                        <dd>
                            An interesting example of historic misinformation, <br> 
                            English explorers in the 1960s believed to have <br> 
                            discovered a new dance style characterized by "robotic", <br> 
                            stilted movements, being practiced by inhabitants of Northern <br> 
                            Alaska and Canada. Later on however it was discovered <br> 
                            that they were just moving like this because they were really cold.
